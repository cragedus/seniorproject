				<h1>General Cat Health & Care Tips</h1>
				<p>
					If this is your first time caring for a cat
					here is some basic information that is good to know when
					you are a first time adopter.

					<h3> How to Make Your Furry Friend Feel Welcome </h3>
					Cats are territorial, and coming into a new home leaves them feeling really uneasy.
					There’s all that unexplored space, and who knows what may lurk there. Do him a
					favor and provide a small area to call his own for the first few days or weeks.
					A bathroom or laundry room works well. Furnish the room with cat amenities, such
					as food, water and a litter box. You’ll want to spend time with your cat, so make
					sure there’s a comfortable place for you to sit as well. For more information there
					is a link on the left hand side underneath the Useful Links heading.
					<br /> <br />
					<h4> Litter Box Tips </h4>
					Fill the litter box with one or two inches of litter and
					place it in his room where he can use it undisturbed.
					After all, everyone deserves a modicum of privacy when
					pottying, and giving him that will help forestall litter box aversion.
					If you are not sure on how to use a litter box or where to evens start
					when it comes to the litter box <a href="https://www.preventivevet.com/cats/how-to-set-up-your-cats-litter-boxes-to-prevent-potty-accidents">click here</a> for more information.
					Also under the Useful Links on the left hand side there is a link to a web page where you can
					find litter boxes, food, and treats for little furry friend.
				</p>

				<p>
					<h3> Claw Maintainence </h3>
					A cat’s claws need to be worn down, and they do this by scratching on things. Since you prefer that it not be your chairs and sofa,
					provide your cat with a socially acceptable scratching place. Some types are made of corrugated cardboard and lie on the floor;
					others are posts which have to be tall enough so that the cat can extend himself upward to scratch. You can encourage your cat
					(once he has arrived) to use the post by sprinkling it with catnip or dangling a toy at the top. He’ll get the idea.
					You’ll probably want a scratching post in each room where there is soft furniture, perhaps blocking access to it.
					You can also install sticky tape (available at pet supply stores) to corners of upholstered furniture to dissuade scratching.
				</p>

				<p>
					We recommend purchasing high-quality, brand-name kitten or cat food.
					Your veterinarian will be able to assess your new cat or kitten and
					determine the best diet. Factors such as age, activity level and health
					make a difference in what and how much a cat should eat.
					<ul>
						<li>
							Cats require taurine, an essential amino acid, for heart and eye health.
							The food you choose should be balanced for the life stage of your cat or kitten.
							Properly balanced foods will contain taurine.
						</li>
						<li>You will need to provide fresh, clean water at all times, and wash and refill your cat’s water bowls daily.</li>
						<li>Treats should be no more than 5-10% of the diet.</li>
						<li>
							Many people feed baby food to a cat or kitten who is refusing food or not feeling well
							Please read labels carefully: If the baby food contains onion or garlic powder, your pet could be poisoned.
						</li>
						<li>Take your pet to your veterinarian if signs of anorexia, diarrhea, vomiting or lethargy continue for more than two days.</li>
					</ul>
				</p>

					<h3> Veternary Information </h3>
					There are lots of ways to ensure that your cat or kitten is healthy.
					The best way is to take your animal to the vet to get checkups and shots normally, and ensure they are getting
					the right vaccinations to prevent illness.
					<br /> <br />
					<h4> Kittens </h4>
					Young kittens will need a vet visit on a monthly basis until they
					reach around 4 months of age to get their necessary vaccinations and
					to check for illnesses. They will need to return as they approach 6 months
					for their spaying or neutering procedure. Kittens reach adulthood at 1 year old,
					when they will also need to visit the vet again for a checkup.
					<br /><br />
					<h4> Checkups for Adult Cats </h4>
					The average adult indoors-only cat should see the veterinarian for regular health exams every six months to a year,
					Cats tend to hide signs of their illnesses, so you may not pick up on them as your vet will.
					By seeing your cat one to two times yearly, the vet will also get an idea of the normal behaviors
					and weight fluctuations of your cat. This is helpful to him in monitoring for changes that could
					indicate an illness. Early diagnosis of any problems is the key to treating them and protecting your kitty's health.
					<br /><br />
					<h3> Vaccinations </h3>
					Cats need to see the vet at least once a year because they need their vaccinations.
					they need what are considered "core" vaccines necessary for all cats.
					Rabies vaccinations are typically required annually, although some newer vaccines can last up to three years.
					The other vaccine recommended for cats is the combination FVRCP vaccine, which protects against viruses and distemper.
					This vaccine is traditionally administered annually. Because the immunity provided by the FVRCP vaccine can actually last up
					to three years in some cases, your vet may recommend a simple titer test for your cat before vaccinating her.
